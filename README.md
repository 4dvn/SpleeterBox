# SpleeterBox
This an implementation of Deezer's Spleeter library, that allows audio separation through the use of Machine Learning,this project it's nothing fancy but I hope it helps some people out there. 
<br>
<br>

I builded this GUI implementation due to the requests on Dylan Tallchief’s video about the Library, I think it’s better than writing the command line every time you want to separate a song. <br>

# Usage
The usage is very simple, first you just need to make sure you had installed and tested python and spleeter as explained in Dylan's Video (The one up there &#8593;), once you have done that you just need to download this project as a .zip
