# SpleeterBox
This an implementation of Deezer's Spleeter library, that allows audio separation through the use of Machine Learning,this project it's nothing fancy but I hope it helps some people out there. 
<br>
<br>

I builded this GUI implementation due to the requests on Dylan Tallchief’s video about the Library, I think it’s better than writing the command line every time you want to separate a song. <br>

# Usage
The usage is very simple, first you just need to make sure you had installed and tested python and spleeter as explained in Dylan's Video (The one up there &#8593;), once you have done that you just need to download this project as a .zip

Once you have the zip file you just need to extract the folder using Winrar or windows default zip files manager, then you should move the folder to a location like My Documents just to make sure you won't delete it by accident.

Then when you have the folder with the files in a secure place you just need to go inside it and doble click the .cmd file to execute the python app, then it will open a window like this

It opens a CMD Window as well but but you don't have to worry about it, you can just minimize that one and use the GUI window 

There are 3 buttons you can interact with 
<br>
1-Select File -> Opens Up a window to navigate the folders in your PC and select the file you want to separate
<br>
2-Select Dir -> Opens Up a window to navigate the folders in your PC and select the folder you want to save the resulting files
<br>
3-Separate Audio -> Once you've selected both File and Dir it starts the process of audio separation

Separation Options
This are the ways you can split the audio, you just need to click the one you desire and then start the process
