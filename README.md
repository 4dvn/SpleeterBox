# SpleeterBox
This an implementation of Deezer's Spleeter library, that allows audio separation through the use of Machine Learning, it's nothing fancy but I hope it helps some people out there. <br>
I builded this GUI implementation due to the requests on Dylan Tallchief’s video about the Library, I think it’s better than writing the command line every time you want to separate a song. <br>
